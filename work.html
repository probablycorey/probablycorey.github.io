      <h2>Issues<h2>
        I currently have the most confusing title of my entire career, Product Manager of project management. I'm making it easier for teams to work better together by improving GitHub Issues.

      <h2>Atom<h2>
        I started hacking on Atom with @defunkt in my spare time, but eventually it became too cool and GitHub decided that my job should be developing Atom full-time. I took Atom from a simple prototype to a production ready text editor used by 500,000 people.

      <h2>iOS App<h2>
        I was hired to do develop iOS applications for GitHub. After 3 months of development I created a mobile issues app, but decided creating a mobile web interface for GitHub was a better idea than a native GitHub app.

      <h1>iOS Contracting : Started in 2008</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      I started developing iOS apps before the SDK was even released. Once Apple "opened up" the platform there was a great demand for iOS apps and very few developers. What started as a hobby turned into starting my own contracting company and developing apps for many companies.

    <div class="row">
      I was employee #1 at StreetEasy! I loved this job, we had a great team, an amazing product, and I got to code in Ruby. I learned how things get done in a startup, meaning, you just have to do it yourself.

    <div class="row">
      I did a lot at Maxis. I shipped Sims 2, worked on prototypes for SimCity, developed AI tools, migrated the scripting engine to use .Net. But people are mostly interested in what I did in my first month at Maxis, creating the toliets and scripting the bathroom AI in Sims 2.
